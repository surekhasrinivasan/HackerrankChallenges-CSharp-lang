         * Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is not negative; if a negative argument is passed as initialAge, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

        1. yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
        2. amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
            If age < 13, print You are young..
            If age >=13 and age < 18, print You are a teenager..
            Otherwise, print You are old..
