    /* Task 
     * 
     * Given an array, a, of size n distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm. Once sorted, print the following  lines:

        1. Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps.
        where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place
        
        2. First Element: firstElement 
        where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
        
        3. Last Element: lastElement 
        where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
        
        Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.
